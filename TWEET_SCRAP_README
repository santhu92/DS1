	'''' Please go through the below mentioned completely to understand about the project and how to install. 

Project Title : Twitter Scraping
Skills take away From This Project : Python scripting, Data Collection, MongoDB, Streamlit
Domain : Social Media

Motivation (why the project exists) and basics:
This project is started for the learners to understand how to do web scraping.

Installation / How to setup:
make sure your Operating system has the following installed as a pre-requisites if you use this code locally.
anaconda/python installed
I have hot coded the important libraries in the python tweetscrap.py file, below need to be installed manually before you run the python project
pip install snscrape --- to install tweeter scrapper library:
above requires lots of dependencies and those dependencies requirement version varies time to time so install dependencies on the requirement while you using the project
basic libraries will come with the anaconda bundle itself so there is no need to install each and every library seperately.
pip install pymongo ---- this is required for connection to mongo

On Stream lit plat form please copy my requrements.txt which has required library

Copy-pastable quick start code example:
once above pre=requisites is completed Please copy the python file to the anaconda home path where pyhton installable file is present so that it will be easy for you to run puthon, else you need to make changes to environmental variables to run the python from any path in you operating system.
this project requires cmd/terminal to run the code, not on any tools or notebook , as our project ultimate gole is to open a api in browser when code is executed.
